Novelty Starts,Groups of 5-6,4 marker cones,Large open space,"Discuss different starting positions with students. Groups form lines with the first student in each line taking up a different starting position (eg. lying face down, head first; lying face down, feet first; on a side in a reclining position; sitting cross-legged, facing or not facing the direction of travel.)

Reaction Run,Groups of 5-6,2 marker cones or 1 rope per group,Large open space,"The marker cones or rope designate a start/finish line. In a row, students jog away from the start/finish line.
