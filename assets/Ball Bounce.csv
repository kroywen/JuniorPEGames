Sideline Basketball,2 groups of 8-10,1 basketball and colour hands or bibs per 2 groups,Basketball court,"Each group is lined up along opposite sidelines. The first 5 students from each group go on the count. The activity is similar to basketball, with the exception that students on the court may only pass to a sideline student and not directly to another court student. This rule does not apply to successive attempts to score a goal. The ball must be bounced at least once by each student before passing. Sideline students must stay off the court. After each goal the sideline students exchange places with those on the court.

On a signal, the first student picks up a ball and runs bouncing it to the hoop in the opposite line. The first student returns to their hoop to retrieve another ball and repeats the process. At the same time, the second student picks up the ball which was placed in their hoop and runs bouncing it to the next hoop in the line opposite. Group 1 moves all of the balls from hoop to hoop in a zig-zag pattern until all balls are in the last hoop (or hoops). While group 1 is moving the balls, group 2 lines up in single file next to the marker cone opposite the hoop into which all the balls are eventually placed.
