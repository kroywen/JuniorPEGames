Students must hold all landings for 2 seconds.",
Jumping circuit,Whole class,See diagram and activity description,Grassed surface open space,"Set up 7 activity stations. Groups of students spend 3 minutes at each station and rotate on a signal.
Warm up: 'Jack in the Box', 'Pop Goes the Weasel', or teach 'motorbike landings'.
Station 1: Students vertical jump over a cane placed on small marker cones, a wooden block or soft cushion and land in a hoop or chalk circle.
Station 2: Students climb on to a box or foam shape and vertical jump on to a mark (eg a cross) on a mat. The landing should be in a 'motorbike' position.
Station 3: Students devise a jumping pattern of vertical jumps and hops in hoops, or vertical jumps into blue hoops and hops in other colours using a different foot (eg red = right foot, green = left foot).
Station 4: Students vertical jump to touch a suspended ball, soft toy or balloon.
Station 5: Students vertical jump 10 times on a trampette (their hands touch the wall for support), then vertical jump off to motorbike land on a mat. 
Station 6: Students skip with a rope and jump as high as possible. They push off the balls of their feet and extend their toes. Encourage students to try to keep a rhythm.
Station 7: Students crouch to touch the seat of a chair behind them then vertical jump up to touch a wall in front.
