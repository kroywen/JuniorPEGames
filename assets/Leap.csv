Leap the Brook,Whole class,"Ropes, chalk or tape",Large open space,Students divide into 3 groups and leap over parallel ropes or lines marked on the floor/ground. Gradually widen the ropes after each leap.,". Mark lines in a V shape to allow each student to leap across the most comfortable width for them
. Place a series of coloured lines on the floor/ground so that students can attempt different distance leaps"
Fly,Groups of 4-6,4 markers (eg colour bands) per group,Large open space,Set out the markers about 1 metre apart. Students take turns to run up to the markers and leap between them. The forth marker is moved to the spot where the heel of the leaper lands. The forth marker is only moved if the leaper successfully leaps over it.,". The last movement can be a jump instead of a leap
. The pattern can be hop, leap, jump (triple jump practice)
. Students may choose any marker 1, 2, 3 or 4 to pick up and move to their landing spot
"
Wriggles,Groups of 5-10,1 long skipping rope per group,Large open space,"Students holding the ropes wriggle it sideways. Others form a line to leap over the rope.

Student 2 leaps the river, runs on 5 metres and crouches down to form a 'rock'. Student 3 leaps the river then the rock, runs on 5 metres and kneels with their hands on the ground to form a 'bridge'. Student 4 leaps the river and goes under the bridge, runs on 5 metres and stands still to form a 'tree'. The remainder of the group continues to leap over, crawl under, and run around the obstacles until the whole group has finished. Other members of the group then have a turn at being an obstacle. ",
Tap the Top,Pairs,1 small ball and 1 chair/bench per pair,Large open space,1 student stands on a chair and holds the ball to the side with an outstretched arm at shoulder height. The partner takes a 2-3 step run-up and leaps to touch the ball. The height of the ball is progressively raised until the partner cannot leap and touch it. Students change roles. ,.

Snake Leaps,Groups of 5-6,A long rope per group,Large open space,Place the rope on the ground to represent a snake. Students start in the first snake loop and jump over the line to A then leap to B. Students repeat the sequence of jumps and leaps along the snake rope,". Use this activity as a relay, in a circuit or as a tabloid sport"
Space Walk,Groups of 3-6,9 hoops per group,Grassed surface open space,Students create their own journey leaping into hoops. Each landing must be with only 1 foot.,". The teacher calls ""left"", ""right"", ""forwards"", ""backwards"" to indicate in which direction to leap.
. Visual instructions similar to above may be given using cards marked L, R, F, B or left, right, forwards, backwards or use the colours of hoops.
. Introduce memory sequences such as R, L, R, L either verbally or visually."
Long Leaps,Individuals or pairs,"1 rope per student or pair, chalk",Hard surface open space,Place a rope a short distance away from a chalk circle. Students leap from the circle over their rope. They then leap back to the circle. When students are successful they move the rope a little further away.,
Towards Hurdling,Groups of 4-6,6 hoops and 6 markers per group,Grassed surface open space,Place the hoops in a line. Between the hoops add a marker. Students leap over the markers into the hoop. Encourage the opposite hand to slap the lead leg for each leap over the marker.,". Use this activity as a relay, in a circuit or as a tabloid sport
. Place a cane over the top of 2 markers to make a low hurdle to leap over
"
Triple Jumps,Groups of 5-6,3 ropes per group,Large open space,"Make 3 lines with the ropes. A student stands at the first rope and hops over it (same foot), then leaps over the next rope (other foot) and finally jumps over the third rope and lands on both feet. This is repeated until the sequence is established and comfortable. Extend this by adding a single run-up step before the first hop. When this is consistent add a 3-step run-up, then 5 steps, then 7. Extend this again by moving the ropes further apart and finishing the jump in a sandpit or on a crash mat.",
Freeze,2 groups,Colour bands,Large open space,"Students in a group are designated as taggers. All students move around the area looking for a free space. On the call of ""freeze"" students stop.

If they do not clear both branches, they cannot take an egg and must return to their nest for the next bird to try. Students continue for a set time, then count the number of eggs in each nest. ",. Extend the distance between the ropes to encourage a horizontal stretch
Leap Relay,Groups of 6-8,2 ropes per group,Large open space,"The group divides into 2 and lines up at opposite ends with the ropes placed in the middle.
